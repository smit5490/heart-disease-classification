* Other python package/environment manager

## Step 0: Download the Git Repository
Clone the repository locally using the command line:  

>`git clone https://github.com/smit5490/heart-disease-classification.git`

## Step 1: Configure your Data Science Environment
Next, cd into the repository and create a virtual environment called `venv`.
Once your virtual environment is created, use `pip` to install the package
requirements:  

>`pip install -r requirements.txt`
